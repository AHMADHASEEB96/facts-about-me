                            <p> While it sometimes has its own cons, I usually like the idea of being loyal in
                                relationships
                                of all kinds,
                                When I like someone I may stop thinking about my benefits when it comes to thinking
                                about his or hers <br>
                                So is it for work? <br>
                                If the right person is present, this trait will be all pros, sometimes it consumes your
                                soul when the wrong person is
                                the target,
                                Sometimes you want to be selfish. </p>

                                learning lessons, it becomes a great
                                thing to do,

                                <li>Caring so much about things that you forget to notice their flaws and
                                    real values, This really consumes your
                                    time and efforts.</li>

                                <li>Procrastination, nothing really describes how much it is awful and gruesome to delay

                                person who mixes different
                                people's behaviors and judges some based on trust issues with others, People of that
                                type are every where around us, and they are nothing but fire in ashes. so don't be a
                                one. cause each one deserves a whole

                            <h1> </h1>
                            <p> Recently, I made a discovery: my intrapersonal communication is much different from my
                                interpersonal communication. I
                                have struggled throughout my life because people never understand what I really mean or
                                what I want to say. They fail to
                                comprehend my meanings or evaluate my goals correctly.

                                Now I know that this is because my facial and body gestures do not express my feelings
                                or emotions as I want them to be
                                expressed or understood. Although I have tried to become more social and less
                                introverted, the more I try, the more
                                introverted I become. Unfortunately, no one - and I do mean no one - can comprehend what
                                I am going through. </p>

                                I Have been suffering my entire life from things that may seem too easy for you or
                                present me as a fragile person,
                                believe me, they are not and I'm not, each one of us struggles with different obstacles
                                and circumstances in life, we
                                shouldn't judge each other soo much cause it doesn't bring back any positive response,
                                these days I am living a status
                                of Embracing new ideas and lifestyle such as “ people's opinions in me or in what I Do
                                is nothing I can pay too much
                                energy on its all about how to be more comfortable and happy ”, I hope you can follow
                                that approach too.
                                Being loyal, kind, dreaming or even sometimes expressing your anger or anxiety with
                                tears is no shame, we created
                                shameful terms to stick them to ordinary behaviors, and I think this is a shame.
                                I still believe we all suffer somehow from personal traumas or situations we have been
                                through making us slightly trust
                                people or overdo judgement, believe me, that's not the way to go through relationships
                                or to avoid falling in same
                                pits. Instead we can seek new life shapes or persons.

                                Believe me when I tell you that its totally OK to do so much efforts with Nobel
                                intentions in wrong directions or with
                                wrong persons, everything you do causes you pain is a lesson more than a pain, so always
                                try to get out of doors as a
                                new more grown person otherwise still inside suffering , its ok to suffer , pain creates
                                monsters so be one.

                                If you passes a tough situation without feeling any pain it might be for a one of two
                                reasons.

                                <span>- You have suffered enough that you don't feel any more pain whatever it was
                                    big.</span>
                                <span>- Or it wasn't powerful enough to affect you.</span>

                                In this later case maybe you want to knock this door again , get your self in pain till
                                you become another tough person
                                somehow.
                                <span>- Forget people who made you suffer but never forget about suffering.</span>
                                <span>- Review your memories with people left you not for remembering them, but for
                                    finding
                                    lessons in these memories.</span>
                                <span></span>
